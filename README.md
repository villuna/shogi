A 3d shogi game against a shogi bot, made in Godot. I originally started writing this to practice Godot and C# and eventually I ended up writing my own engine for it and turning it into a real game :)

It's still under development so it's a bit buggy and there are a few features missing - in particular I would like the user to be able to load their own USI-compliant shogi bots into the game, and I'd also like to add Japanese translations for everything - but for now it actually kinda works. I might also think about multiplayer in the future, if I ever get around to it.

You can find the repository for the shogi engine itself [here](https://github.com/villuna/nanoshogi).

(I'm sorry if my kanji pixel art is not very good - Japanese is my second language)
